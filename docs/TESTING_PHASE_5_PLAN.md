| **Total** | **12-17h** | **+33-45%** | **~75-85%** |

## Implementation Order

### Today's Goal: Phase 5A (Layout Components)
Start with layout components since they're:
1. Used on every page
2. Relatively simple to test
3. High impact on coverage
4. Foundation for page tests

### This Week's Goal: Phases 5A + 5B
Complete layout and critical pages to reach ~68% coverage

### Next Week's Goal: Phases 5C + 5D
Add modal and component tests to reach ~82% coverage

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Coverage reaches 70%+ (minimum goal)
- [ ] Coverage reaches 80%+ (stretch goal)
- [ ] All critical user flows tested
- [ ] All layout components tested
- [ ] All pages have basic tests
- [ ] CI pipeline passes
- [ ] No regression in existing tests

## Notes

- Focus on user-facing functionality first
- Don't aim for 100% coverage on complex components
- Prioritize happy paths and error states
- Use existing test patterns from Phase 1-4
- Update coverage thresholds after each phase
