# Testing Implementation - Decision Tree

## 🎯 Start Here

**Question:** Are you ready to start implementing tests?

```
YES → Go to Section A: Pre-Flight Check
NO  → Read TESTING_PLAN.md first
```

---

## Section A: Pre-Flight Check

**Question:** Do you have 3-4 hours of uninterrupted time?

```
YES → Continue to Section B
NO  → Schedule time, then return
```

---

## Section B: Environment Check

**Question:** Is your git working directory clean?

```bash
git status
```

```
Clean (no changes) → Continue to Section C
Dirty (has changes) → Commit or stash changes first
```

---

## Section C: Application Health

**Question:** Does the application run successfully?

```bash
bun dev
```

```
YES (app runs) → Continue to Section D
NO (errors)    → Fix application first, then return
```

---

## Section D: Choose Your Path

**Question:** What do you want to do?

```
A. Full Phase 1 Setup (3-4 hours)
   → Go to IMPLEMENTATION_START_PLAN.md
   → Follow steps 1-11 in order
   → Goal: First test passing

B. Quick Exploration (30 minutes)
   → Go to Section E: Quick Start
   → Install deps and create config only
   → Goal: Understand setup

C. Review Only (1 hour)
   → Read TESTING_PLAN.md
   → Read TESTING_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
   → Understand strategy before implementing
```

---

## Section E: Quick Start (30 min exploration)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
bun add -D vitest @vitest/ui @vitest/coverage-v8
bun add -D @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
bun add -D jsdom msw
```

**Question:** Did installation succeed?
```
YES → Continue to Step 2
NO  → Check error message:
      - Network issues? → Retry
      - Version conflicts? → Check package.json
      - Bun issues? → Update bun: `bun upgrade`
```

### Step 2: Create vitest.config.ts
```bash
# Copy from IMPLEMENTATION_START_PLAN.md Step 2
```

**Question:** Does TypeScript compile?
```bash
bunx tsc --noEmit vitest.config.ts
```

```
YES (no errors) → Quick start complete! 
                  → Now decide: Continue full setup or stop here?
NO (errors)     → Check imports, verify vite.config.ts exists
```

---

## Section F: Full Implementation Decision Points

### After Step 3 (MSW Handlers)

**Question:** Do you understand MSW and API mocking?

```
YES → Continue to Step 4
NO  → Read MSW docs: https://mswjs.io/docs/
      → Review handlers.ts comments
      → Then continue
```

---

### After Step 6 (Test Utils)

**Question:** Are you getting TypeScript errors?

```
NO ERRORS → Continue to Step 7
ERRORS    → Common issues:
            1. "Cannot find module" → Check imports
            2. "Type error" → Verify provider types
            3. "Cannot find name" → Add types to tsconfig
```

---

### After Step 9 (First Test)

**Question:** Did you create the test file?

```
YES → Continue to Step 10 (Run tests)
NO  → Copy from IMPLEMENTATION_START_PLAN.md Step 9
```

---

### After Step 10 (Run Tests)

**Question:** Are all tests passing?

```
✅ ALL PASSING (13/13)
   → Continue to Step 11 (Coverage)
   → You're almost done!

❌ SOME FAILING
   → Check error messages
   → Common issues:
     1. "Cannot find module" → Check imports
     2. "Timeout" → Check query client retry: false
     3. "Not found" → Check test-utils import path
     4. "MSW error" → Check handlers setup

❌ ALL FAILING
   → Go to Section G: Troubleshooting
```

---

## Section G: Troubleshooting Decision Tree

### Issue: Tests won't run

**Error:** `Cannot find module 'vitest'`

```
Solution:
1. bun install
2. Verify vitest in package.json devDependencies
3. Try: bun add -D vitest --force
```

---

### Issue: TypeScript errors

**Error:** `Cannot find name 'describe'`

```
Solution:
1. Add to tsconfig.json:
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "types": ["vitest/globals", "@testing-library/jest-dom"]
     }
   }
2. Restart TypeScript server
3. Restart IDE
```

---

### Issue: Tests hang/timeout

**Symptom:** Tests never complete

```
Check:
1. Query client has retry: false? → Fix in test-utils.tsx
2. MSW server started? → Check vitest.setup.ts
3. Async operations? → Add await to user interactions
4. Infinite loops? → Check component logic
```

---

### Issue: MSW not intercepting

**Symptom:** Network errors in tests

```
Debug:
1. Check API base URL matches handlers
2. Add logging to handler:
   http.get('/api/users', ({ request }) => {
     console.log('Intercepted:', request.url)
     return HttpResponse.json([])
   })
3. Verify server.listen() in beforeAll
4. Check handler order (specific before generic)
```

---

### Issue: Coverage not generating

**Error:** Coverage command fails

```
Check:
1. @vitest/coverage-v8 installed?
2. vitest.config.ts has coverage config?
3. Try: bun add -D @vitest/coverage-v8 --force
```

---

## Section H: Post-Implementation Decisions

### Question: All tests passing?

```
YES → Go to Section I: Next Steps
NO  → Go to Section G: Troubleshooting
```

---

## Section I: Next Steps Decision

**Question:** What do you want to do next?

```
A. Commit and Push
   → git add .
   → git commit -m "feat: add testing infrastructure"
   → git push origin feature/testing-infrastructure
   → Create PR

B. Add More Tests
   → Create LoadingSpinner.test.tsx
   → Create Modal.test.tsx
   → Build confidence with simple components

C. Start Phase 2 (Authentication)
   → Create AuthContext.test.tsx
   → Follow TESTING_PLAN.md Phase 2
   → Higher complexity, higher value

D. Take a Break
   → You've done great work!
   → Review what you learned
   → Come back refreshed for Phase 2
```

---

## Section J: When Things Go Wrong

**Question:** Do you need to rollback?

```
YES → Execute rollback:
      git checkout .
      git clean -fd
      rm -rf node_modules
      bun install
      
      Then decide:
      - Try again? → Go to Section A
      - Need help? → Review docs
      - Take break? → That's okay!

NO  → Continue debugging
      → Check IMPLEMENTATION_START_PLAN.md troubleshooting
      → Check TESTING_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
```

---

## Section K: Time Management

**Question:** How much time do you have?

```
30 minutes
→ Quick exploration (Section E)
→ Install deps + config only

1 hour
→ Steps 1-6 (setup without tests)
→ Stop before creating test file

2 hours
→ Steps 1-9 (create first test)
→ May not finish running tests

3-4 hours
→ Complete Phase 1 (Steps 1-11)
→ First test passing + coverage

Multiple sessions
→ Day 1: Steps 1-6 (setup)
→ Day 2: Steps 7-11 (first test)
→ Day 3: More component tests
```

---

## Section L: Confidence Check

**Question:** How confident are you with testing?

```
BEGINNER
→ Start with Section E (Quick Start)
→ Read TESTING_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md thoroughly
→ Take breaks between steps
→ Don't rush

INTERMEDIATE
→ Follow IMPLEMENTATION_START_PLAN.md
→ Skim docs for reference
→ Should complete in 3-4 hours

EXPERT
→ Skim IMPLEMENTATION_START_PLAN.md
→ Adapt to your preferences
→ Should complete in 2-3 hours
```

---

## Section M: Success Validation

**Checklist:** Have you completed all of these?

```
[ ] Dependencies installed (Step 1)
[ ] vitest.config.ts created (Step 2)
[ ] MSW handlers created (Step 3-4)
[ ] vitest.setup.ts created (Step 5)
[ ] test-utils.tsx created (Step 6)
[ ] package.json updated (Step 7)
[ ] .gitignore updated (Step 8)
[ ] Button.test.tsx created (Step 9)
[ ] Tests running (Step 10)
[ ] Coverage generated (Step 11)

All checked? → Phase 1 COMPLETE! 🎉
Some missing? → Go back to that step
```

---

## Section N: What If I Get Stuck?

**Question:** Where are you stuck?

```
Installation (Step 1)
→ Check bun version: bun --version
→ Try: bun upgrade
→ Check network connection

Configuration (Steps 2-5)
→ Check TypeScript errors
→ Verify file paths
→ Compare with examples in docs

Test Creation (Step 9)
→ Copy exact code from IMPLEMENTATION_START_PLAN.md
→ Don't modify yet
→ Get it working first, then customize

Test Execution (Step 10)
→ Check error messages carefully
→ Go to Section G: Troubleshooting
→ Add console.log for debugging

Coverage (Step 11)
→ Verify @vitest/coverage-v8 installed
→ Check vitest.config.ts coverage section
→ Try: bun test:run first (without coverage)
```

---

## Section O: Emergency Exit

**Question:** Need to stop and come back later?

```
Safe stopping points:

After Step 1 (Dependencies)
→ Safe to stop
→ No files created yet
→ Just installed packages

After Step 6 (Test Utils)
→ Safe to stop
→ Setup complete, no tests yet
→ Can resume with Step 7

After Step 9 (Test Created)
→ Safe to stop
→ Test file created but not run
→ Can resume with Step 10

After Step 11 (Complete)
→ Commit your work!
→ Don't leave uncommitted
```

---
